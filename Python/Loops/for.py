#A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
#This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
#With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  
 
#The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
